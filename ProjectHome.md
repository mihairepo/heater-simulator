This application simulates the temperature evolution of a virtual heating element. The temperature of the virtual heater is measured by a virtual thermistor. The power applied to the heating element can be controlled by various controller algorithms, which try to maintain a certain target temperature. The application can be used to compare the performance of the algorithms or to optimize their parameters.
